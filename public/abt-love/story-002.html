        <h1 class="story-title">002 - when you love someone</h1>
        <p>on the moment you open your heart, you are exposed to a big gap of vulnerability. so, you'll find that no matter how rocky your heart is
            or how frozen it is, it will either be shattered into pieces; melting or a literal heart-schattering. 
        </p>
        <p>
            the moment you open your heart is to be taken care of, like a careful hand enveloping a baby's hand. i hope the hands that holds you feels like
            a blanket on a winter, and a breeze that cools on a summer day. or a cold watermelon straight from the refrigerator. cool right? because to be safe
            in love feels like a mother's hug, and the awakening of a little child in the body of an adult. like you. like me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            and so... loving someone <em>is</em> very beautiful. a lot of poetries was inspired by it. but also, to love someone is to let them see the monster
            that sits at the corner of your heart. "see, this is me." and does they stay? i hope for you that they do, and i hope for them that you do too. i hope
            i don't have to wonder if the encounter was bitter or sweet. but then again, there is no pure sweet nor bitter--in my opinion--in this world. at the end,
            we will cry in the sweetness, and we will laugh in the bitterness of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
            in the end, a heart, whomever it belongs, are precious. so guard your heart, because from it flows life. and no matter how sweet you are, i hope that at least,
            you will choose the person who'll gonna handle your heart, carefully.
        </p>
