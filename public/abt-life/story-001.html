        <p>
            there are times when you might say, "i have no friends" even when you had best friend(s). 
            that kinda moments are moments that can amplify that loneliness more.
        </p>
        <p>
            relationships between humans are so fragile, isn't it? yesterday we were so close. but look at us now --
            we don't even talk anymore. you know, i have a tendancy to stray away from the stereotypes of not talking anymore,
            miss you, wish you were here moments -- but i guess we are really all, mostly the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            look at you wishing they'd text you first, call you first, miss you more than you miss them.
            we tend to unconsiously, i think, think about "what about me?" when those cracks starts to appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            maybe i am childish to feel sad when no one is texting me when i feel lonely, or when i wish i had someone to talk to.
            but, that's the thing... i never really had close friends, nor had i experienced dating irl before. because this is my
            first
            experience. do you have to laugh? do you have to make fun of me?
        </p>
        <p>
            in the end, i realised that no matter how hard i try, there will be no one that could save me from this loneliness; but God would.
            God would. Jesus would.
        </p>
        <p>because that's the thing -- relationships between humans are so fragile. so i'll go to God.</p>
