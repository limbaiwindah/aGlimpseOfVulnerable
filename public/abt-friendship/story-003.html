        <h1 class="story-title">003 - we go through honeymoon too</h1>
        <p>
            i realised friendships have honeymoon phase too when i realised me and my best friends were leaving that glittering sunshine and rainbow phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            did you realise that? that little irritations that were slowly emerging to something big enough to threaten the bond that seemed unbreakable.
            did you felt the cold distance that burns more than bonfire? little by little you thought it would be fine -- until it didn't. until your eyes opened
            wide enough to see the realness of who they are. but i think it's kinda beautiful, though... in a way.
        </p>
        <p>
            maybe the phase don't end synchronically, considering that one of them says she still feel like she is in cloud 9 in our friendship. i think she is just
            a sweet girl. or perhaps, the real ugly me haven't been made clear to her. but why am i so pessimistic about that? why do i want them to see my monster?
        </p>
        <p>
            perhaps, in the end... whether the glasses of roses that we used to see broke or not shouldn't matter when navigating a precious bond between each other.
            maybe we should just put the glasses down from the start.
        </p>
